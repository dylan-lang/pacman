# pacman

A package manager for Dylan. Find, download, install, and uninstall any version of any
Dylan package and its dependencies.

(This is a library, not the name of an executable, so there is no conflict with the
`pacman` package manager for Arch Linux.)

Some high-level documentation for pacman is included in the
[dylan-tool](https://github.com/dylan-lang/dylan-tool) documentation.
